#in this SQL I queried a database to quantify different stats about Fortune 500 companies. 

#1. Which technology companies earn more than 350 in revenue, and what is their revenue in millions?
SELECT 
    company_name,
    revenue,
    (revenue * 1000000) AS revenue_in_millions
FROM fortune_companies
WHERE industry = 'Technology'
  AND revenue > 350;

#2 How many companies in each industry offer healthcare benefits?
SELECT 
    industry,
    COUNT(*) AS total_companies,
    SUM(healthcare_benefits) AS companies_with_healthcare
FROM fortune_companies
GROUP BY industry;

#3. Categorize companies as “Generous PTO”, “Standard PTO”, or “Low PTO”.
SELECT
    company_name,
    paid_time_off_days,
    CASE
        WHEN paid_time_off_days >= 22 THEN 'Generous PTO'
        WHEN paid_time_off_days BETWEEN 16 AND 21 THEN 'Standard PTO'
        ELSE 'Low PTO'
    END AS pto_category
FROM fortune_companies;

#4. Which industries have an average employee tenure greater than 6 years?
SELECT
    industry,
    AVG(avg_employee_tenure) AS avg_tenure
FROM fortune_companies
GROUP BY industry
HAVING AVG(avg_employee_tenure) > 6;

#5. Which companies do not offer healthcare benefits but still generate over 250 in revenue?
SELECT
    company_name,
    revenue,
    healthcare_benefits
FROM fortune_companies
WHERE healthcare_benefits = 0
  AND revenue > 250;
