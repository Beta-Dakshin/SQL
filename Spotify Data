# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table, creating a database. 

#Once my database was set up I I queried SQL to find the artist with the highest average popularity

SELECT artist_name, AVG(popularity) AS avg_popularity
FROM spotify
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY avg_popularity DESC
LIMIT 1;

#I searched for all tracks with a danceability score higher than 0.8

SELECT track_name, artist_name, danceability
FROM spotify
WHERE danceability > 0.8;

#Then I queried the amount of songs each artist has in the dataset

SELECT artist_name, COUNT(*) AS total_tracks
FROM spotify
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY total_tracks DESC;
